Should the input-field use type="date" or type="text"?

= Introduction =
HTML5 has a lot of cool new features. One of those new features is a {{{<input type="date" />}}} tag for datepickers. Unfortunately this tag isn't supported by most browsers. You can find an [http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html#type-date article about the type date] on diveintohtml5.org.


= Pro: Why the datepicker should use type="date" =
  * it's semantically better
  * the datepicker written by us could only be a fallback, if the browser doesn't support type="date"

= Contra: Why we should use type="text" =
  * We can be sure how browsers react
  * Always the same design on every browser
